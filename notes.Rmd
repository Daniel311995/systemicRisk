## Liquidity runs

Identification through *natural experiment*; need:

- sudden event (e.g. bank failure like Northern Rock)
- corresponding data set that allows us to identify bank's exposures at time of failure

Problems (for researchers):

- in times of crisis governments/central banks tend to step in
- impossible to learn how the system behaves with response to the shock (if left on its own)

Forward guidance:

- the "central bank put" (think of put as downside protection): in case things go wrong, central bank will step in
- I want to take systemic risks, since these are the ones that the central bank will avoid
